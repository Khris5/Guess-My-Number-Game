# Guess-My-Number-Game
This is my First game project. This project may have bugs as its my first. Please if you find any bugs notify me.
This project was gotten from Jonas Schmedtmann course on java script.

Game Logic:

Enter any number in the input field between 1 and 20 then click 'Check'.

Then javascript generates a random between 1 and 20 and if it matches the number you entered then you won.

If it doesn't then it gives you a hint on if you should guess higher or lower.
